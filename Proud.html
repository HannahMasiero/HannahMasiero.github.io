Imagined Monologue 
    <br>
    <br> 
    I Don’t Care That the Temperature is Freezing, I Will Order an Iced Coffee 
<br>
<br>
You think the cold is gonna stop me? You’re wrong. I will walk my definitely not spoiled self up to the register and order my iced coffee extra loud so everyone knows I am better than them. “Hi, I will have a large iced double shaken espresso with three pumps of vanilla reduced sugar syrup, almond milk, vanilla sweet cream cold foam, and extra caramel drizzle please!” I really have to get the reduced vanilla sugar otherwise the drink is just too sugary. People just THINK hot coffee is better when in reality we ALL KNOW iced coffee is best. 
<br>
<br>
In terms of fashion, this is just an important and essential part of my piece. An accessory for short. If I don’t have this drink, what do I have? It is a part of me and the persona I want to show the world. I am going to my first ever interview today, and I need to look strong. This iced cold drink will help me with that. I need the interviewee to recognise and respect me as a person.   
<br>
<br>
Look how cool I look holding this in the middle of the winter. Everyone must think I am a badass for ordering this drink. I smile through the pain of my freezing fingertips. And don’t you dare get me started on wearing gloves. HELLO? I am not an imbecile. Fashion before reality. 
<br>
<br>
Fashion is everything. Therefore I will continue to completely necessarily freeze my ass off while drinking this iced coffee in the depths of winter. Fashion isn’t just about the clothes, it’s about the vibe you give off. Vibes are everything, ask Virgil Abloh the artistic director of Louis Vitton’s menswear. He has completely changed the game by adding streetwear in this luxury fashion collection. He ignored the status quo and listened to the vibe inside him. That is who I aspire to be one day. This iced coffee puts me a step closer every day. 
<br>
<br>
Looking like a polar bear sipping iced coffee on a bench chair in the middle of a blizzard is what I’m going for. I don’t care that my mother thinks I look like an idiot, she’s one of those hot coffee drinkers. My greatest fear about getting older is that I will lose my pride of drinking iced coffee in the winter. Then what will I be? A regular old person? I can’t, Virgil Abloh will be so disappointed in me. What would I have worked all my life for? Please god, if you really are up there, do not let me get to that point in my life. 
<br>
<br>
Either way, for now, my soul is brave, one of the bravest. This is a challenge I love to face every morning. You are weak if you need the warmth of a drink to get you through your day. Sure, I can’t feel my hand, and my toes are cold because the iced cold drink is going through my entire body making me want a heated blanket, and now my cheeks are bright red and my face is back to pale after spending all last night using self tanner. 
<br>
<br>
This world is out to get me, they want to see me fail. I will not, no matter the circumstances, drink hot coffee. I will never stoop that low. I am like Kanye West, I will never let the public and societal norms get me to change. Kanye and I are in it together. Breaking norms left and right. That is a frightening thought. “Hey barista, give me the hottest coffee you have.”

Adventure Report 
<br>
<br>
Sitting in the beautifully decorated restaurant with a just as beautiful waiter, Elliot ordering our fourth drink of the night, my friends and I noticed the time. We not so patiently wait for our last drink and the bill before chugging and running out of the restaurant. The time reads 11:45 pm and it was our last night in Paris to get a picture with the sparkly eiffel tower. My four friends and I were in Paris for my birthday weekend. I have had a dream of spending my birthday by the eiffel tower since I was a little girl. My friend Cait turns on her google maps supposedly taking us to the tower. We will arrive there right at midnight. We are going slow, not walking straight, very intoxicated. In my head I know we won’t make it. It’s 11:48 pm now. Something tells me we are going the wrong way. We are walking uphill, and we need to get to the river. I yell out from behind “guys, this is the wrong way, we are running to the river!”. They laugh, they don’t believe me. I ignore them. I start running. At the moment it did not matter if they were going to follow me or not. I am not missing this, my dream. My phone had no service, but I turned to snap maps. I look at the map, I start sprinting down the middle of the road in my heels. I have trained all my life for this moment. My friends start to follow, we look like a pack of wolves running down the middle of the road screaming. I do not stop, I never look back, I can see my friend Emma out of the corner of my eye. It’s 11:53 pm. She’s with me. I hear the rest start to slow down. I do not care, I run even though my legs and feet are aching, my lungs are giving out, but my heart is as strong as ever. People looking out their windows to see what the absurd sound is outside at this hour. It’s 11:55 pm. They laugh, they cheer, they know exactly what we are doing. I can’t stop now, I have an audience. The street seems to be getting longer and longer. I don’t give up; it’s not an option. It’s 11:57 pm. Three more blocks, two more blocks, one more block and I am at the bridge. 11:58 pm. The eiffel tower starts to shine as I get closer. I see it in the distance. I just have to cross the street and I’m there. 11:59 pm. Emma is still right next to me laughing, knowing this is completely insane, but agreeing in my choice to run. We get there, one minute to spare. I caught my breath, we decided on the angle, fixed our hair and outfit and started snapping away. We knew we only had 10 minutes. We took 2 minute intervals to take photos. The rest of the group gets there, out of breath, and starts taking their own photos. We stopped and watched it sparkle together while we lit a cigarette to get the true “french moment” we were searching for. At that moment, I knew this is where I am meant to be and life is strictly about the adventures you take and who you go on them with. We ended the night standing on the bridge, dancing in the street, and laughing about this adventure. We all knew we would never forget this moment, and we would tell our future children about it. We walked across the street and had a celebratory drink since it was officially my birthday.

Journalistic Profile on Serena Williams
<br>
The End of an Era, The Start of a Family
<br>
<br>

The woman has won more than any other professional athlete in The Open Era of tennis with a total of 23 Grand Slams, and four gold medals at the Olympics. She is one of the youngest female tennis players to win a title at the age of 17. Her career has been full of wins, injuries, and sacrifice. Now at the age of 40, Serena Williams has announced her retirement. The driving reason for ending her monumental career — her sex.
<br>
<br>

Serena Williams announced her retirement on the cover of Vogue’s September issue. She chose this route to ensure this dramatic change in her life was in her own words and on her own time. Throughout the article, Williams explains how the word ‘retirement’ has a negative connotation in her mind. Her thoughts are “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution” (Nast).  The power of this announcement left many of her fans shocked and wondering whether they truly saw her full potential on the court. That said, Williams has redefined what it means to be a female athlete by challenging and overcoming the inherent gender bias in professional sports. 
Williams’ life has revolved around tennis since she was only 18 months old when her older sister Venus, also a professional tennis player, pushed her around a tennis court in a stroller. Williams has expressed how Venus’ success made her become the player she is today. She told Vogue that she wasn’t always a good tennis player - it didn’t come naturally to her.  In order to achieve success, she had to push herself every day. It took a lot of motivation and determination, which she’s had ever since she was young, playing alongside her sister. This determination led to an early-onset struggle for perfection at the age of five. In Vogue Williams recalled, “I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it” she said (Nast). This struggle for perfection made the decision to retire all the more difficult for her, but she is not finished with this sport, and she knows it. 
<br>
<br>
        
Unlike Williams, many other famous athletes have retired due to injuries or suffered from burnout from their sport. For example, another unbelievably talented tennis player, Roger Federer announced his retirement due to the improper healing of a knee injury. Maria Sharapova retired due to a shoulder injury and the fact that she lost her love of the sport. Caroline Wozniak was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and could no longer play. Ashleigh Barty retired simply because she felt it was the right time. All of these reasons stemmed from injury or lack of wanting to play; to put it metaphorically, their flames for tennis have simply burnt out. For Williams however, her fire has not dwindled - her flame for this sport still burns bright. As such, her retirement cannot be chalked up to a loss of love or a decline in health; she is healthy, and in good shape, and her passion for this sport is as strong as always.
<br>
<br>
    
This difficult decision came after learning of her daughter’s wishes to be “a big sister”. Willaims owes her success and love of the sport to her sister who pushed her to greatness. Williams not only has Venus but three other sisters. She wants to give her daughter, Olympia, the love and unique dynamic that a sibling brings. This made it a tough choice for Williams, forcing her to decide between two of her life’s greatest loves — tennis and family. In Vogue, she verbalizes this saying, “Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair.” and “If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family” (Nast). She also expresses on The Tonight Night Show with Jimmy Fallon, “Tom Brady started an amazing trend. That’s what I want to say” after being asked if she will ever return to professional tennis (Media). She uses the comparison to Tom Brady multiple times. He is one of the most talented and record-breaking players in his sport, however, he’s in his forties and also debating retirement. The difference between the two athletes is that Tom Brady can continue his legacy with three healthy, beautiful children at home. Meanwhile, Williams has to cut her legacy short to create the family she wants. She was eight weeks pregnant with Olympia during her final win at the Australian Open in 2017. Although she has proved she can do it before, she has stated she does not want to be a pregnant athlete because “Williams endured serious health complications after the birth of her daughter, including a pulmonary embolism that left her bedridden for several weeks and postpartum depression” (Smith). It is hard enough to be one of the best professional athletes in your sport, but it's even harder and some might argue nearly impossible to do it while growing another person inside of your body.
<br>
<br>
        
Will Williams ever be satisfied? Inevitably, she’ll never have exactly what she wants. Although this sport is her calling and passion, not everyone can retire successfully and with enough money at the age of 40 in their profession. Additionally, being 40 in a professional, competitive sport like tennis can be difficult when you are up against new players who are younger, faster, and stronger. Age plays a huge role in the performance of a professional athlete. According to Ion Țiriac a retired professional tennis and hockey player, and now a successful Romanian businessman “at this age and the weight she is now, she does not move as easily as she did 15 years ago” and she would retire “if she had a little decency” (Cash). Ion Țiriac did not win a single Grand Slam during his tennis career. Ironically, Ion Țiriac retired around the age of 40, with no big wins, and is publicly criticizing Williams for retiring, when she is the one with 23 Grand Slams. Her legacy will continue to live on forever, while Ion Țiriac will just be known for bad-mouthing the iconic woman, who has won more than any male athlete in NFL, NBA, and MLB.

Serena Williams is a name people will say forever. She will never be forgotten as a tennis champion, and sure enough, she will be known for something new very soon. As of now, she is retiring from tennis, but that won’t stop her from pursuing other paths. Forbes, a world-renowned business magazine said it best “Serena will now move to the next phase of her life, growing her family, working on her business ventures, and enjoying life off the court” (Zagoria). Williams is already a businesswoman, and has created a small firm to start investing in products, people, and places that she politically and socially supports.“This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are” (Nast). Williams’ motivation off the court will continue as usual. She is excited about this new adventure and cannot wait for Olympia to be a big sister. Williams states it plainly for Vogue, “The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense” (Nast). 
<br>
<br>
        
The game of tennis will forever be changed thanks to Serena Williams. She hopes that she made a difference in this game, “But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all” (Nast). Serena Williams, a woman of strength, courage, and determination, has changed the way the world views women in sports and the power of females both on and off the court.
