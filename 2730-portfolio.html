   I am currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University. I am studying Business Administration and Communications with a concentration in Marketing. I have always had a passion for marketing and interest in the business behind it. I am very eager to learn more about the business world! I spent my first semester of college in London where I got to learn a new culture and find my way around a new city. There, I spent my days off going to museums and other historical places in London to learn more about the culture. However, my favorite thing to do in London was find the local spots and just sit and observe. Mostly cafes or restaurants. I would go by myself with my computer or a book and watch the local people interact and socialize. That is what I find most important when learning about a new place.

I grew up in a small town in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. My family owns a popular Italian restaurant, Baba Louie’s that has become a part of who I am. This restaurant has shaped the person I am today, and I am beyond grateful for that. I have been able to learn the importance of professionalism, perseverance, problem-solving, and most importantly, people skills. I grew up in that restaurant and have a strong grasp of how a business operates. I hope to use my skills to add to another business in different ways.

I spend my free time reading any romance or crime novel. Reading allows me to escape from reality, and dive into a new one. I have always loved reading and being able to be a part of a different reality. I also enjoy spending my time outside with friends and family. The people I am surrounded by each and every day are my inspiration. I love to try new things, whether it’s food, activities, or workouts. I know the importance of balance and I try to find something interesting every day. I prefer to stay occupied, although I know the importance of rest. I am a determined person and like to complete things to their best ability. Working on a new project, toward an end result gives me immense satisfaction and motivation.
